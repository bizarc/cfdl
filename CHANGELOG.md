# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project follows Semantic Versioning: https://semver.org/

## [0.5.1] - 2026-07-28

Release-pipeline fixes. No behaviour change: the compiler, engine and packs
are identical to 0.5.0.

- The VS Code extension's `package-lock.json` still declared `0.0.1` while
  `package.json` tracks the project version, so `npm ci` refused to install
  and the Extension lint step failed on every tagged release from v0.3.0
  onward. The lockfile now carries the real version and is bumped with it.
- Playground examples were stale against the repo's models: the schedule
  syntax migration in 0.4.0 changed the `.cfdl` sources without regenerating
  them, and the site workflow had been failing on `main` as a result.
- Monte Carlo dispersion is asserted as a property in
  `tools/analytic-checks.py` rather than as a golden. A long run over a
  pack-lowered expression containing `pow()` is not bit-identical across
  platforms, so it passed locally and failed on Windows CI. The golden keeps
  its deterministic scenario sweep.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-28

Contract terms, stochastic layering, and currencies. Breaking: see below.

### Contract terms are a literal or one declared input

A term kept only the first token after `=` and silently discarded the rest, so
`rent_year = 12 * 8500` compiled as `12` — no diagnostic, and no validation
caught it because `12` parses cleanly. That is now an error
(`E0004_EXPECTED_TOKEN`), and a term is defined as either a literal or a
reference to one declared input:

```cfdl
assume annual_yield ~ Normal(mean=5000, stdev=350, clip=[4000, 6000])

terms {
  ppa_price = 3000                 // contractual fact
  mwh_year  = inputs.annual_yield  // driver, supplied per run
}
```

Contracts stay declarative records of what was signed; anything that varies is
named and supplied from outside. Because `inputs.*` is the single channel that
scenarios and Monte Carlo already write to, one declaration serves a fixed
case, a scenario sweep and a stochastic run alike.

This also fixes Monte Carlo through pack contracts. Terms were baked into
lowered expressions as literals, so a trial sampled a variable the expression
did not contain and returned a degenerate distribution with no warning.

- `E5010_TERM_UNKNOWN_INPUT` — a term naming an input that was never declared.
- `E5011_TERM_CLIP_OUT_OF_BOUNDS` — a deferred term's value cannot be checked
  at compile time, but its distribution's `clip` states the range it can reach,
  so where a pack declares bounds the clip is checked against them.
- `E5009_LOWERED_EXPR_INVALID` — pack-lowered amount expressions are now
  compile-checked. The engine evaluates a failed expression as zero with only a
  warning, so a malformed expansion became a silently empty stream.

### Model currency

`model "x" currency INR` now parses; every metric is denominated in it, and it
defaults to USD when omitted. Streams must agree with it: cash flows are summed
period by period, so a 500 USD outflow in an INR model was being subtracted as
500 INR, producing a total in no currency at all
(`E2107_STREAM_CURRENCY_MISMATCH`). Cross-currency models require an explicit
conversion in the amount expression — the language applies no implicit FX.

### Run configuration

- All five distributions (`fixed`, `normal`, `uniform`, `log_normal`,
  `triangular`) and `clip` now work from `run.json`, matching what
  `assume x ~ Dist(...)` offers. `stdev` is accepted alongside `stddev`.
- Unknown keys are rejected. Parsing was lenient and the override consumers
  ignore unrecognised keys, so a misspelling produced a clean run with wrong
  numbers and no warning.
- `docs/schemas/run.schema.json` — the format had no schema at all.
- An in-source `run monte_carlo trials N seed S` is honoured. It was parsed and
  lowered, then dropped by the engine, so a model asked for trials and got a
  single deterministic pass. An explicit run config still wins.

### Breaking

- Terms with trailing tokens, mixed-currency models, and unknown run-config
  keys now fail to compile or run.
- Twelve example run configs set `discount_rate`, which is not the wire name
  (`annual_discount_rate`) and was therefore ignored — those examples ran
  undiscounted while claiming 0.1. Migrated rather than aliased, so the
  correction is visible; their numbers change.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-28

Payment timing. Breaking: discounted metrics change for every model.

### Schedules honour the declared interval

A stream's recurrence interval was discarded — the parser dropped the token and
the compiler substituted the model's calendar frequency — so every stream paid
in every period. A model written `every quarterly` on a monthly grid paid twelve
times a year, silently. Intervals are now parsed, required, and honoured.

Interval and cadence became separate words because they are separate concepts:
a calendar is adjectival and describes the grid (`time calendar monthly`); an
interval is a noun and describes how far apart one stream's payments fall
(`every month`). Only intervals have a weekly member.

`on day <n>` and `on eom` work for the first time. The compiler had always
emitted the rule; the engine had no field for it and dropped it on
deserialization.

### Payment timing is specified and discounted correctly

A payment belongs to the period that earned it. What separates the two annuity
conventions is where in that period the cash falls, and therefore how far it is
discounted — one mechanism rather than three special cases:

| Schedule | Position | Discounted from |
|---|---|---|
| `due` | start | period start |
| default, `on eom` | end | period end |
| `on day <n>` | day n | that point in the period |

This is Excel's convention, matching `pmt(rate, nper, pv, [fv], [due])` in the
expression library. Mid-period discounting follows from the same rule.

Written honestly, a five-year par bond now returns an NPV of exactly zero — the
identity that exposed the defect, since the first coupon previously landed
undiscounted and the final year fell off the end of the range.

See `docs/12_payment_timing.md`.

### Verification against closed-form finance

`tools/analytic-checks.py` asserts identities drawn from the definition of
present value, so they hold for any correct implementation and cannot be
satisfied by making two implementations agree: a par bond is worth par, a level
annuity matches `(1-(1+i)^-n)/i`, an annuity due is worth `(1+i)` times the
ordinary annuity, and a fully-amortising loan is worth its principal. Part of
`make ci`.

The benchmark suite compares each model against a reference implementation,
which cannot detect a convention both sides share — that is how the original
defect survived eight passing benchmarks. Every reference was corrected to
separate one-shot flows from recurring ones.

### Breaking

- Discounted metrics (NPV, IRR, and anything derived) change for every model.
  Undiscounted cash flows are unchanged for models scheduling at their calendar
  frequency, which was every model in the repository.
- Schedule intervals are spelled as singular nouns: `every month`, not
  `every monthly`. The interval is now required after `every`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-27

First public release. CFDL is pre-1.0: the language and IR spec is v0.1, and
interfaces may change until 1.0 freezes the IR and Results schemas.

### Language and engine

- Deterministic compilation: the same sources, pack version and compiler
  version emit byte-identical IR, enforced by a golden suite.
- Native `cfdl-calc` expression engine with decimal-exact money arithmetic and
  an Excel-compatible function library (annuities, day counts, business-day
  calendars, MACRS, prepayment conversions).
- Deterministic DCF, scenarios, and seeded Monte Carlo, emitting
  schema-governed Results JSON.

### Domain packs

- `energy`, `cre`, `credit` and `opco`, each supplying contract types,
  template-driven lowering rules, domain metrics, and declarative validations.
- Every pack is gated by a parity suite: each model is diffed period-by-period
  against an independent reference implementation.

### Surfaces

- CLI (`cfdl compile`, `cfdl run`, `cfdl validate`).
- Python SDK (`cfdl_sdk`) with pandas result accessors.
- WebAssembly build powering the in-browser playground at cfdl.dev.
- HTTP API server, and a VS Code extension with LSP diagnostics.

### Licensing

- Business Source License 1.1 (source available, not open source). Each
  released version converts to Apache-2.0 four years after its release.
